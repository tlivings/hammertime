### v1.0.0

* ES6 conversion
* Simplified API to remove `before` and `after` functions in favor of just config.

### v0.1.4

* Bumped dependencies.

### v0.1.3

* Use closures instead of bind.

### v0.1.2

* Made iteration non-recursive to allow for higher iteration numbers. With async it assumed `fn` is in fact async and therefor performs recursively safely with high iterations.

### v0.1.1

* Memory leak fixes.
* Some code comments / documentation.
